I join this competition [data-science-bowl-2019], which ends on January 15, 2020. For the data feature, I do some work on the series features, using word2vec, LDA and node2vec. 

1. [wide and deep]
1. [node2vec]
1. [LDA]

The baseline feature engineering I forked from @Massoud_Hosseinali2019. However, it helps me focus on series features.
Also, I use LTSM model to elaborate series features, I forked from @Grecnik2019.
